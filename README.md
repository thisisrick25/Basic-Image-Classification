# Getting Started

## About

Completed this project as a part of the [Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/projects/tensorflow-beginner-basic-image-classification) guided project offered by Coursera Project Network.

## Description

Learned the basics of using Keras with TensorFlow as its backend and used it to solve a basic image classification problem. Created, trained, and evaluated a Neural Network model that will be able to predict digits from hand-written images with a high degree of accuracy. Also have learned the fundamentals of neural networks, TensorFlow, and Keras.
